# ...Because every project could use some design love

One day, [@misosoup](https://dribbble.com/misosoup) and I were chatting about some design work she recently completed for an [open source project](https://dribbble.com/shots/1365943-Exploration-Style-Guides/attachments/195294). After seeing the style guides and mockups, we chatted more about how we could formalize the process of introducing open source project owners to designers who need to build out their portfolios. With that in mind, we came up with Design Love.

Design Love is essentially a matchmaking system that advertises a random selection of open source projects to the design community. Designers get real world experience and open source projects get proper branding, enabling their projects to get more recognition.

The first version will be email based, but we'll be adding the following features to foster a real community:

* Community voting per project
* Designer submission feedback and rating
* Donation system

If you have any issues with the site or want to request a feature, feel free to open a pull request or file an issue.
